0.0.0.4 - Friendlyname for each ds18b20 sensor. Fixed a bug in cooler algorithm.
0.0.0.5 - After sensor frendlyname set, committing flash.
0.0.0.6 - Dont send measurements, if network time is unknown.
	This is quite stable version.
0.0.0.9 - Check very carefully that the ota package is behaving well,
        before acknowledging it. The name <refrigerator> in mosquitto topics
	is taken by an api call. So it is not needed to be hardcoded in source
	anymore.
